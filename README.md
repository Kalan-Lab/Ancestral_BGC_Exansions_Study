# Salamzade_et_al_Systematic-BGC-Investigations

Code and datasets for analyses featured in Salamzade, Kalan, and Currie, 2024.

## Directory stucture:

* **BacterialPhylum_Genome_Selection**: Code for selection of species-level representative genomes from five bacterial phyla (Actinomycetota, Bacillota, Cyanobacteriota, Myxococcota, and Pseudomonadota) for investigation of BGC content and associations with other genomic/ecological factors (Table S1).
* **Systematic_Bacterial_SpeciesLevel_Annotations**: Code and example commands/scripts for various trait annotations of species-level representative genomes (e.g. antiSMASH, CAZy/dbCAN, etc.).
* **BacterialPhylum_Phylogeny_Construction**: Code and example IQ-TREE commands for construction of phylum level phylogenies based on 74 conserved proteins across bacteria from GToTree.
---
* **BacterialAndArchaealOrder_Genome_Selection**: Code for selection of genus-level representative genomes from orders for the bacterial and archaeal timetree analysis (Table S2).
* **BacterialAndArchaealOrder_TimeTree_Construction**: Code and scripts for constructing the timetree of bacteria and archae order representatives using MCMCTree.
* **BacterialAndArchaealOrder_Ornstein-Uhlenbeck_BGC_Count_Shift**: Code to run Ornstein-Uhlenbeck analysis to detect expansions in median BGC-ome size across bacterial order representatives.
---
* **Actinomycetota_Comparative_Genomics**: Code pertaining to primary Actinomycetota analysis on core set of 133 high-quality genomes for which OrthoFinder was run.
