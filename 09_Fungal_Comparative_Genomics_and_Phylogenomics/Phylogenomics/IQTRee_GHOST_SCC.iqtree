MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD TREE
-----------------------

Log-likelihood of the tree: -2688903.4835 (s.e. 16361.6241)
Unconstrained log-likelihood (without tree): -133673.2475
Number of free parameters (#branches + #model parameters): 23666
Akaike information criterion (AIC) score: 5425138.9670
Corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) score: 1125631582.9670
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score: 5613679.9305

**************************** WARNING ****************************
Number of parameters (K, model parameters and branch lengths): 23666
Sample size (n, alignment length): 21306

Given that K>=n, the parameter estimates might be inaccurate.
Thus, phylogenetic estimates should be interpreted with caution.

Ideally, it is desirable that n >> K. When selecting optimal models,
1. use AIC or BIC if n > 40K;
2. use AICc or BIC if 40K >= n > K;
3. be extremely cautious if n <= K

To improve the situation (3), consider the following options:
  1. Increase the sample size (n)
  2. Decrease the number of parameters (K) to be estimated. If
     possible:
     a. Remove the least important sequences from the alignment
     b. Specify some of the parameter values for the substitution
        model (e.g., the nucleotide or amino acid frequencies)
     c. Specify some of the parameter values for the rates-across-
        sites model (e.g., the shape parameter for the discrete
        Gamma distribution, the proportion of invariable sites, or
        the rates of change for different rate categories under
        the FreeRate model)

CONSENSUS TREE
--------------

Consensus tree is constructed from 1000 bootstrap trees
Log-likelihood of consensus tree: -2689013.762296
Robinson-Foulds distance between ML tree and consensus tree: 16

Branches with support >0.000000% are kept (extended consensus)
Branch lengths are optimized by maximum likelihood on original alignment
Numbers in parentheses are bootstrap supports (%)
