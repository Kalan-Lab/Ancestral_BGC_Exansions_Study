MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD TREE
-----------------------


**NOTE**: Consensus tree has higher likelihood than ML tree found! Please use consensus tree below.
Log-likelihood of the tree: -3184053.4732 (s.e. 19997.9658)
Unconstrained log-likelihood (without tree): -129859.1270
Number of free parameters (#branches + #model parameters): 31771
Akaike information criterion (AIC) score: 6431648.9465
Corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) score: 2025288072.9465
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score: 6684149.1100

**************************** WARNING ****************************
Number of parameters (K, model parameters and branch lengths): 31771
Sample size (n, alignment length): 20900

Given that K>=n, the parameter estimates might be inaccurate.
Thus, phylogenetic estimates should be interpreted with caution.

Ideally, it is desirable that n >> K. When selecting optimal models,
1. use AIC or BIC if n > 40K;
2. use AICc or BIC if 40K >= n > K;
3. be extremely cautious if n <= K

To improve the situation (3), consider the following options:
  1. Increase the sample size (n)
  2. Decrease the number of parameters (K) to be estimated. If
     possible:
     a. Remove the least important sequences from the alignment
     b. Specify some of the parameter values for the substitution
        model (e.g., the nucleotide or amino acid frequencies)
     c. Specify some of the parameter values for the rates-across-
        sites model (e.g., the shape parameter for the discrete
        Gamma distribution, the proportion of invariable sites, or
        the rates of change for different rate categories under
        the FreeRate model)

CONSENSUS TREE
--------------

Consensus tree is constructed from 1000 bootstrap trees
Log-likelihood of consensus tree: -3184052.189727
Robinson-Foulds distance between ML tree and consensus tree: 0

Branches with support >0.000000% are kept (extended consensus)
Branch lengths are optimized by maximum likelihood on original alignment
Numbers in parentheses are bootstrap supports (%)
