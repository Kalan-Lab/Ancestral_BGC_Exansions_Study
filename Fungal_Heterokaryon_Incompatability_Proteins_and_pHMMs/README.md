> [!NOTE]
> This folder just contains useful files for annotation of HI proteins in fungal genomes/proteomes for users who are interested in doing this. For additional details on the HI-related analyses we did for our manuscript, please instead see [this folder](https://github.com/Kalan-Lab/Ancestral_BGC_Exansions_Study/tree/main/09_Fungal_Comparative_Genomics_and_Phylogenomics/HI_Domain_Architectures_and_HET_Phylogeny).

Known HI-associated proteins were gathered from many studies/reviews, including but not limited to the following:

- "Non-self recognition and programmed cell death in filamentous fungi" by Glass & Dementhon 2006
- "Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Cell Fusion and Heterokaryon Formation in Filamentous Fungi" by Daskalov, Heller, Herzog, Fleisser, & Glass 2017
- "Regulated cell death in fungi from a comparative immunology perspective" by Daskalov 2025
- "Vegetative Incompatibility Loci with Dedicated Roles in Allorecognition Restrict Mycovirus Transmission in Chestnut Blight Fungus" by Zhang, Spiering, Dawe and Nuss 2014
- "Identification of Allorecognition Loci in Neurospora crassa by Genomics and Evolutionary Approaches" by Zhao, Gladieux, Hutchison, Bueche, Hall, Perraudeau, Glass 2015

Gathering of protein sequences was done by searching key-terms on UniProt + gene names / identifiers on NCBI

Final architectures considered as HI-associated are:

* HET
* Het-C
* ATP-cone|Ribonuc_red_lgN|Ribonuc_red_lgC
* HMG_box
* MAT1-1-2
* Patatin|NB-ARC
* HeLo|HET-s_218-289
* HET|NACHT|WD40
* SET|Rubis-subs-bind|zf-MYND
* Peptidase_S8
* GLTP
* RVT_2
* SERF-like_N
* CYSTM
* Ccdc124
* Fructosamin_kin
* Patatin|TPR_10

> *Note, "|" is used to separate domain names from Pfam-A in the architecture strings above. Also, tandem-repeating domains are collapsed. For instance, WD40 can repeat multiple times in the HET|NACHT|WD40 architecture.*
