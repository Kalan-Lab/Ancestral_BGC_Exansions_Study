Note, IQ-TREE log files might have "GHOST" in the output label. This was a mis-labelling and should be disregarded. We did not run IQ-TREE in GHOST mode, we ran it with with a heterotachy aware partition model as described in the methods of the manuscript and can be observed from the parameters of the log files.
